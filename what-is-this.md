# What is this?

[Wynncraft Wiki](https://wynncraft.gitbook.io/wynncraft-wiki) is the documentation that outlines the usage and purpose of the [Wynncraft Recreation](https://github.com/Wynncraft-Recreation) project. From outlining how to use the plugin and other components of the plugin to understanding motive and how the internals of the plugin works, this wiki aims to be the golden resource that is used to learn from.\


## Project Purpose

The purpose behind creating this project isn't to copy, distribute, or to create a network as [Wynncraft ](https://wynncraft.com/)does provide. To be honest, [Wynncraft ](https://wynncraft.com/)is just far too large to even make as a server with a 1-person team and it's just not right to be the person to copy another companies/persons work. Rather, I aim to create this project to allow others to learn from it. Being able to pass on my knowledge, expertise, and experience when it comes to the systems maintained and created for this project I hope that others can learn from the challenges I encountered and use this project as a base to understand the generic systems found within many Minecraft/Bukkit/PaperMC plugins.\


## Final Words

With this all in mind, I offer you the best of luck as your surf through my codebase and documentation on this project, and I hope you take the knowledge I've passed on an give it to others.\

Thank you very much, and enjoy.
